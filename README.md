### Overview
This is my first project in data analysis. This project includes data cleaning and visualization of Grocery Store Dataset from Costco's Online Marketplace. This project provides visualization of the prices by product category, distribution of price and ratings per product category.


### Data Source
The Dataset used in the project is 'GroceryDataset.csv' file uploaded by Bhavik Jikadara on Kaggle.

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebook


### Data Cleaning
Before the visualization, the following tasks were done:
1. Data importation
2. Data inspection (data shape, formats and types)
3. Data cleaning

### Data Visualization
There are total of six (6) charts that were plotted. These are:
1. Average price per category plot
2. Number of products per category plot
3. Distribution of price plot
4. Number of reviews per category plot
5. Weighted rating per category plot
6. Unweighted rating per category plot

### Results
1. The first barplot shows that the three products with highest average price are:
- Deli
- Meat & Seafood
- Seafood' categories

Meanwhile, the second barplot shows the most product category that were sold are:
- Snacks
- Pantry & Dry Goods
- Candy

2. From the distribution of price plot, it shows that the mean price is $61.26 which mainly driven by products with lowest average price -'Snacks' and 'Candy' categories.
3. The three (3) categories which had the highest review counts are:
- Floral
- Kirkland Signature Grocery
- Gift Baskets

Consequently, the categories were also the highest weighted ratings.

4. The three (3) categories which had the highest unweighted ratings are:
- Breakfast
- Organic
- Kirkland Signature Grocery

### Conclusions and Recommendations
1. From the first three barplots, it shows that the marketplace sold more products which were cheaper. This is reasonable since it is cost effective not to stock more of expensive products.
2. The barplot of the highest review count provides insight which products are getting more attention after sale. This is both for the reason of bad and good products. This also shows that customers are willing to spend more time giving review which suggest they are "into" the product.
3. The product categories 'Breakfast' and 'Organic' have the highest unweighted ratings which suggest that they could provide profit however, the data are unweighted rating so it is still better to research more about the performance of these product categories in their market.
4. Kirkland Signature Grocery is one of the highest reviewed and also in the top unweighted rated category which strongly suggest that this is a great product in the market. Additionally, this product category balanced in terms of average price and number of products in the market. It is therefore recommended to research about if the product category is in demand and could hint to add more products in this category in the marketplace.
